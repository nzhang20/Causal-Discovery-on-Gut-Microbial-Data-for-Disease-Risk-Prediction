	abstract = {Complex microbial communities shape the dynamics of various environments, ranging from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to the soil. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and data analysis have provided drastic improvements in microbiome analyses, for example, in taxonomic resolution, false discovery rate control and other properties, over earlier methods. In this Review, we discuss the best practices for performing a microbiome study, including experimental design, choice of molecular analysis technology, methods for data analysis and the integration of multiple omics data sets. We focus on recent findings that suggest that operational taxonomic unit-based analyses should be replaced with new methods that are based on exact sequence variants, methods for integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data, and issues surrounding compositional data analysis, where advances have been particularly rapid. We note that although some of these approaches are new, it is important to keep sight of the classic issues that arise during experimental design and relate to research reproducibility. We describe how keeping these issues in mind allows researchers to obtain more insight from their microbiome data sets.},

@article{rahman2023birdman,
	abstract = {Quantifying the differential abundance (DA) of specific taxa among experimental groups in microbiome studies is challenging due to data characteristics (e.g., compositionality, sparsity) and specific study designs (e.g., repeated measures, meta-analysis, cross-over). Here we present BIRDMAn (Bayesian Inferential Regression for Differential Microbiome Analysis), a flexible DA method that can account for microbiome data characteristics and diverse experimental designs. Simulations show that BIRDMAn models are robust to uneven sequencing depth and provide a \&gt;20-fold improvement in statistical power over existing methods. We then use BIRDMAn to identify antibiotic-mediated perturbations undetected by other DA methods due to subject-level heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate how BIRDMAn can construct state-of-the-art cancer-type classifiers using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, with substantial accuracy improvements over random forests and existing DA tools across multiple sequencing centers. Collectively, BIRDMAn extracts more informative biological signals while accounting for study-specific experimental conditions than existing approaches.Competing Interest StatementG.D.S.-P. and R.K. are inventors on a US patent application (PCT/US2019/059647) submitted by The Regents of the University of California and licensed by Micronoma; that application covers methods of diagnosing and treating cancer using multi-domain microbial biomarkers in blood and cancer tissues.

@article{sazal2021causalgut,
	abstract = {Causal inference in biomedical research allows us to shift the paradigm from investigating associational relationships to causal ones. Inferring causal relationships can help in understanding the inner workings of biological processes. Association patterns can be coincidental and may lead to wrong conclusions about causality in complex systems. Microbiomes are highly complex, diverse, and dynamic environments. Microbes are key players in human health and disease. Hence knowledge of critical causal relationships among the entities in a microbiome, and the impact of internal and external factors on microbial abundance and their interactions are essential for understanding disease mechanisms and making appropriate treatment recommendations. In this paper, we employ causal inference techniques to understand causal relationships between various entities in a microbiome, and to use the resulting causal network to make useful computations. We introduce a novel pipeline for microbiome analysis, which includes adding an outcome or ``disease''variable, and then computing the causal network, referred to as a ``disease network'', with the goal of identifying disease-relevant causal factors from the microbiome. Internventional techniques are then applied to the resulting network, allowing us to compute a measure called the causal effect of one or more microbial taxa on the outcome variable or the condition of interest. Finally, we propose a measure called causal influence that quantifies the total influence exerted by a microbial taxon on the rest of the microiome. Our pipeline is robust, sensitive, different from traditional approaches, and able to predict interventional effects without any controlled experiments. The pipeline can be used to identify potential eubiotic and dysbiotic microbial taxa in a microbiome. We validate our results using synthetic data sets and using results on real data sets that were previously published.},

This relationship has not been investigated at the population level, and its biological mechanism remains unknown. Objective: To examine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among persons with HCV infection in a representative sample of the general adult population of the United States. Design: Cross-sectional national survey. Setting: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988?1994. Participants: 9841 persons older than 20 years of age for whom data on HCV infection and diabetes were complete. Measurements: The presence of diabetes was ascertained by using American Diabetes Association guidelines based on fasting plasma glucose measurement and medication history. Presence of HCV infection was assessed by testing for serum HCV-specific antibodies (anti-HCV). Results: Of the 9841 persons evaluated, 8.4{\%} had type 2 diabetes and 2.1{\%} were anti-HCV positive. Type 2 diabetes occurred more often in persons who were older, were nonwhite, had a high body mass index, and had low socioeconomic status. Type 2 diabetes was less common in persons who acknowledged previous illicit drug use.

	abstract = {Assessment and characterization of gut microbiota has become a major research area in human disease, including type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent endocrine disease worldwide. To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.},

@article{zhou2019t2d,
	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a growing health problem, but little is known about its early disease stages, its effects on biological processes or the transition to clinical T2D. To understand the earliest stages of T2D better, we obtained samples from 106 healthy individuals and individuals with prediabetes over approximately four years and performed deep profiling of transcriptomes, metabolomes, cytokines, and proteomes, as well as changes in the microbiome. This rich longitudinal data set revealed many insights: first, healthy profiles are distinct among individuals while displaying diverse patterns of intra- and/or inter-personal variability. Second, extensive host and microbial changes occur during respiratory viral infections and immunization, and immunization triggers potentially protective responses that are distinct from responses to respiratory viral infections. Moreover, during respiratory viral infections, insulin-resistant participants respond differently than insulin-sensitive participants. Third, global co-association analyses among the thousands of profiled molecules reveal specific host--microbe interactions that differ between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals. Last, we identified early personal molecular signatures in one individual that preceded the onset of T2D, including the inflammation markers interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) paired with xenobiotic-induced immune signalling. Our study reveals insights into pathways and responses that differ between glucose-dysregulated and healthy individuals during health and disease and provides an open-access data resource to enable further research into healthy, prediabetic and T2D states.},
